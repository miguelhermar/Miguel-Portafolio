# About me
Hello! I'm Ruchi Bhatia, a Computer Engineering graduate pursuing my Master's degree at Carnegie Mellon University.

I'm the youngest 3x Kaggle Grandmaster in the Notebooks, Datasets, and Discussion category, the Leader of Data Science at OpenMined, and one of the 21 Data Science Global Ambassadors at Z by HP.

Having started coding at an early age, I can say my interest in this field has only grown with time. I gravitate more towards Data Science and Data Analysis. Working in the technology sector of various MNCs like Sony and Colgate-Palmolive has helped me gain relevant experience in the industry. As businesses today are becoming more inextricably linked with information technology, I strive to utilize my expertise to bridge the gap between technology and business.
